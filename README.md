# Getting Started
`adminware` must be installed within `/opt` using:
```
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/alces-software/adminware.git
cd adminware
make setup
```

# Adding Commands
Commands can added to `adminware` `batch run` and `open` features. `batch`
commands are ran on a single or group of nodes and the results are recorded
for latter viewing.

`open` commands establishes and interactive session with a single node.
This allows for full screen applications (e.g. `vi`, `top`, `bash`). The
results from `open` are not logged.

Commands can be added to `batch` and `open` by creating the following
config files (respectively):
`/var/lib/adminware/tools/{batch,open}/<command-name>/config.yaml`

The config files should follow the following format:
```
# Could be system command like `uptime` or tool dir command like
# `./script.rb`.
command: command_to_run

# Full help text for command, will be picked up and displayed in full when
# `help` displayed for command, or first line displayed when `help` displayed for
# parent command (see http://click.pocoo.org/5/documentation/#help-texts).
help: command_help
```

# Development setup

It is recommended that Adminware is developed locally (so you have all your
local development tools available) and synced, run, and tested in a clean
remote environment (to be in an environment close to what it will normally use
in production, and to avoid polluting or depending on things in your local
environment).

You can try adapting this setup, but this is what I'm doing (which works):

1. Have remote CentOS/RedHat EL7 machine available to sync and develop on, with
   `root` access available - I have:
  ```bash
  [root@bob adminware]# uname -a
  Linux bob 3.10.0-862.11.6.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Aug 14 21:49:04 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
  ```

2. Then locally:
  ```bash
  make rsync PASSWORD="password for machine" IP="ip of machine"
  ```

3. Remotely:
  ```bash
  cd /tmp/adminware
  make development-setup
  ```

# Development process

- To keep remote machine as setup above constantly in sync with local changes
  (leave this running):
  ```bash
  gem install rerun # If you don't have this already.
  make watch-rsync PASSWORD="password for machine" IP="ip of machine"
  ```

- To run synced, development `admin` CLI remotely:
  ```bash
  cd /tmp/adminware
  bin/starter [ADMIN_COMMANDS_AND_ARGS]
  ```

- To run tests remotely:
  ```bash
  make unit-test
  ```
