# Development setup

It is recommended that Adminware is developed locally (so you have all your
local development tools available) and synced, run, and tested in a clean
remote environment (to be in an environment close to what it will normally use
in production, and to avoid polluting or depending on things in your local
environment).

You can try adapting this setup, but this is what I'm doing (which works):

1. Have remote CentOS/RedHat EL7 machine available to sync and develop on, with
   `root` access available - I have:
  ```bash
  [root@bob adminware]# uname -a
  Linux bob 3.10.0-862.11.6.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Aug 14 21:49:04 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
  ```

2. Then locally:
  ```bash
  make rsync PASSWORD="password for machine" IP="ip of machine"
  ```

3. Remotely:
  ```bash
  cd /tmp/adminware
  make development-setup
  ```

# Development process

- To keep remote machine as setup above constantly in sync with local changes
  (leave this running):
  ```bash
  gem install rerun # If you don't have this already.
  make watch-rsync PASSWORD="password for machine" IP="ip of machine"
  ```

- To run synced, development `admin` CLI remotely:
  ```bash
  cd /tmp/adminware
  bin/starter [ADMIN_COMMANDS_AND_ARGS]
  ```

- To run tests remotely:
  ```bash
  make unit-test
  ```
